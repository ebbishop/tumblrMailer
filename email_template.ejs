  <p>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm web programming full-time at the Grace Hopper Academy and enjoying 
    my time.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Grace Hopper.
    Check out my new posts here: 
    <ul>
    <% for(var i = 0; i < latestPosts.length; i++){ %>
      <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>><%= latestPosts[i].title %></a></li>
    <%}%>
    </ul>

    Hope you're well,<br>
